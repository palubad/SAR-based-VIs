# 🌲🌳 Supplementary data and ML models to estimate SAR-based Vegetation indices and biophysical variables for forest ecosystems [in Central Europe]

This study presents a machine learning-based approach to estimate optical vegetation indices and biophysical variables (hereafter referred to as VIs) using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and ancillary data for forest monitoring. 
The best-performing models were Random Forest Regressor (RFR) for LAI and FAPAR and XGBoost (XGB) for EVI and NDVI - these models are available in this repository. These models were trained on temporally and spatially aligned time series (TS) datasets, containing Sentinel-1 SAR data, Sentinel-2 multispectral data, DEM-based features and meteorological variables. It provides an accurate and timely alternative to optical-based VIs.

## ⚙️ Details

The study explores the feasibility of using SAR-based features in combination with additional datasets (e.g., DEM-based features and meteorological data) to estimate optical VIs, specifically, LAI, FAPAR, EVI and NDVI. Traditional optical remote sensing methods are often hindered by cloud cover, making it difficult to obtain continuous and reliable vegetation monitoring data. This research addresses this challenge by applying SAR data, which is unaffected by atmospheric conditions.
Using ML, particularly RFR and XGB, the study demonstrates that SAR-based VIs can replicate the patterns of optical-based VIs, while also offering advantages such as higher temporal resolution and all-year monitoring. The inclusion of ancillary data improves model accuracy, particularly in differentiating forest types and seasonal variations. The transferability tests confirm that the methodology generalizes well across Central European forests and shows potential for large-scale monitoring applications.
